and continue as usual.

#### Why am I getting 404 error page when I clicked on a contributor's name
The names of the contributors are linked to their author's pages. If the you are getting 
404 error page, you probably don't have a template created for the autor's page in your
theme's folder; please create one in the root of your themes folder and the link will automaticly pick it up.
